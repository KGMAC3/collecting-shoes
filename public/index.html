    </h1>
    <p>Collecting shoes is a hobby hobby that I need to do and I'm not sure why.The more shoes the better and after buying one, I need to buy more in order to satisfy my needs.
      I need a second closet in order to store all the shoes I get. Every place I visit, there is always a need to get a pair of shoes from that exact area. </p>

      <p>I am a sneakerhead. A sneakerhead is highly experienced in finding shoes that are rare and try and collect them. Usally building up the collection is just a person trying to expand their shoe value and have more inventory. When a person has a big shoe collection, they can take advantage of the many styles they can work with. </p>
  
    Goat is a great website in order to find the best selection. I have used their services in order to make sure I am getting the best selection of inventory. 
    It can be tough collecting shoes from Goat sometimes since prices are most of the time not retail anymore due to the limited amount of shoes being produced. 
    Goat has a clean website that labels the exact pricing of all the inventory that is in stock or out of stock. 

    
    <p></p> Stock X is another after market selling website that sells other items besides shoess
    I use Stock X whenever I cannot find the exact selection that I need from GOAT. Stock X also shows what product brands are rising in stock. 
    It is perfect for someone to find out which shoes that they are trying to collect are rising in stock.
